<h1> Toy-problems code challenge <h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
Basically, this is a javaScript based challenge, aimed at building experience writting basic javaScript programs.
It comprises of three challenges each with a diffrent set of instructions to help gain deeper understanding on javaScript.
<h4> Student grade generator</h4>
The student grade generator is a program to help assign grades to students in accordance with their perfomance.
This program allows the input of total marks attained by the student and outputs the correct grades.
This program grades marks ranging from 0 - 100 marks. Any input out of this range will return an error.

<h4> Speed Detector</h4>
This is an app that monitors the speed of our drivers to help save lives.
A speed of 70km/h and below is okay according to the countries rules and regurations.
For speed above the limit of 70km/h, the driver is given a point for every 5km/h.
That is for every 5 kilometers above the limit the driver gets a point.
The redline is a maxi,um of 12points which results to the driver's driving license being suspended.
The program allows input of the current speed which in return outputs the message as follows:
<ol>
  <li><i><B>If the speed is less than 70km/h; the program returns "OK"</B></i></li>
  <li><i><B>If the speed is above  70km/h and less than 130km/h the program returns "Number of points acquired "</B></i></li>
  <li><i><B>If the number of points acquired is 12 or greater; the program returns "License Suspended"</B></i></li>
</ol>
